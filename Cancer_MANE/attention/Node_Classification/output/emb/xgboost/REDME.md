# Driver gene prediction



`Driver_prediction.py` is a driver gene prediction based on XGBoost. Running it will produce a prediction score (pre_sorce_specificset-all_withoutv.xlsx) for each gene and a metric(Gold_standard_specificset-all_withoutv.xlsx) for each cancer.

`Number_predictions.xlsx` is the number of predicted driver genes for each cancer.
